<h1>3 of My Favorite All-Time Movies</h1>

<hr />

<h2>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h2>
<p>This is a beautiful cinematic depiction of J.R.R. Tolkien's written masterpiece.</p>

<h2>Pride and Prejudice</h2>
<p>This movie was my introduction to Jane Austen, which makes it one of my 
    favorite movies ever.

<h3>Moonstruck</h3>
<p>I love the depiction of a close-knit Italian-American family in New York. 
    There's a certain "over-the-topness" in their interactions with each other.
